# CB-Siblings: Chilean School Assignment System Analysis

Research project analyzing the Chilean school assignment system (SAE) with focus on sibling priorities in joint applications. This project examines how sibling priority policies affect family application strategies and student allocations in Chile's centralized school choice system.

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and analysis for studying joint sibling applications in the Chilean Centralized Assignment System (Sistema de Admisi√≥n Escolar - SAE). The project uses administrative data, surveys, and simulations to understand the impact of sibling priority policies on family decision-making and school allocations.

## Repository Structure

### Core Configuration
- **`0_main.do`** - Main Stata configuration file that sets up global paths and graph styles. This is the entry point for running Stata scripts.

### Analysis Folders

#### **`1_feedback/`** - Feedback and Probability Analysis
Contains scripts for calculating assignment probabilities and analyzing feedback provided to families during the application process. Includes preliminary data cleaning and probability calculations for the regular application period.

#### **`2_surveys/`** - Survey Data Processing
Processes survey responses from families about their preferences over joint allocations. This data is used to understand family preferences and validate model assumptions.

#### **`3_analysis/`** - Main Analysis
Primary analysis folder containing:
- **`1_regular_period/`** - Analysis of the regular application period including preliminary statistics and simulations
- **`2_complementary_period/`** - Analysis of the complementary application period

Each period includes data cleaning, descriptive analysis, and counterfactual simulations using deferred acceptance algorithms.

#### **`4_reports/`** - Generated Reports
Contains output reports and presentations for different audiences:
- **`diagnostic/`** - Diagnostic reports and exploratory analysis
- **`mineduc/`** - Reports formatted for the Chilean Ministry of Education
- **`preliminar/`** - Preliminary findings and early-stage analysis
- **`surveys/`** - Survey-specific reports and summaries
- **`yale/`** - Academic presentations and reports

#### **`5_paper/`** - Academic Paper Production
Contains scripts and files for producing the academic paper:
- **`1_clean/`** - Data cleaning specific to paper analysis
- **`2_analysis/`** - Final analysis code for paper results
- **`3_simulations/`** - Simulation code for paper counterfactuals

#### **`6_model/`** - Model Documentation
Documentation of the theoretical model and presentations explaining the allocation mechanism and policy counterfactuals.

#### **`7_estimation/`** - Preference Estimation
Framework for estimating structural preference parameters using survey data. Implements exploded logit models to estimate preferences over joint sibling allocations. See `7_estimation/README.md` for detailed documentation.

## Workflow

1. **Setup**: Run `0_main.do` to configure paths and settings
2. **Data Processing**: Process feedback data (`1_feedback/`) and survey responses (`2_surveys/`)
3. **Analysis**: Run period-specific analysis in `3_analysis/`
4. **Estimation**: Estimate preference parameters in `7_estimation/`
5. **Paper Production**: Generate final results in `5_paper/`
6. **Reporting**: Create audience-specific reports in `4_reports/`

## Technologies

- **Stata**: Primary tool for data processing and econometric analysis
- **Python**: Used for simulations, probability calculations, and preference estimation
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive analysis and exploration
- **LaTeX**: Academic paper and table production

## Key Methods

- **Deferred Acceptance Algorithms**: Simulating school assignment mechanisms
- **Causal Inference**: Identifying effects of sibling priority policies
- **Structural Estimation**: Estimating family preferences from survey data
- **Counterfactual Simulations**: Analyzing alternative policy scenarios

## Data

This project uses confidential administrative data from the Chilean Ministry of Education. Data files are not included in this repository.
